### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### Entity Extraction Pipeline
```python
# Dual approach: DistilBERT + spaCy
entities = nlp_engine.extract_entities(text, use_bert=True)

# Output with ontology alignment
entity = EntityExtraction(
    start=8, end=11, label="QUANTITY", text="500", confidence=0.95,
    ontology_id="linear_feet", ontology_category="unit"
)
```

#### Structured Token Output
```json
{
  "input_text": "Install 500 linear feet of concrete footing with #4 rebar",
  "analysis_metadata": {
    "work_type": "concrete_work",
    "operation": "install",
    "confidence_score": 0.87,
    "total_quantity": 500.0,
    "primary_unit": "linear_feet"
  },
  "entities": [
    {
      "text": "linear feet",
      "label": "UNIT", 
      "ontology_id": "linear_feet",
      "ontology_category": "unit",
      "confidence": 0.85
    }
  ],
  "ontology_alignment": {
    "materials": [{"original": "concrete", "canonical": "concrete"}],
    "units": [{"original": "linear feet", "canonical": "linear_feet"}]
  }
}
```

## 🚀 Demonstrated Capabilities

### 1. Entity Extraction with Confidence
```
Input: "Install 500 linear feet of concrete footing with #4 rebar"
Output: 
  - OPERATION: "install" (0.90)
  - QUANTITY: "500" (0.90) 
  - UNIT: "linear feet" → linear_feet (0.85)
  - MATERIAL: "concrete" → concrete (0.80)
  - MATERIAL: "rebar" → rebar (0.80)
```

### 2. Work Type Classification
```
"Pour concrete slab" → concrete_work
"Excavate soil with track hoe" → excavation  
"Frame exterior walls" → framing
"Install electrical conduit" → electrical
```

### 3. Ontology Integration
```
"LF" → linear_feet (unit)
"CMU" → concrete_masonry_unit (material)  
"track hoe" → excavator (equipment)
"SF" → square_feet (unit)
```

### 4. Unit Conversions
```
100 linear_feet = 30.480 meters
1000 square_feet = 92.900 square_meters
25 cubic_yards = 675.000 cubic_feet
```
