  - **Automated model versioning** with MLflow
  - Docker image building and pushing
  - Environment-specific deployments
  - Performance testing with k6
  - Automated releases and rollbacks

### 4. Observability Stack ✅
- **Prometheus** (`monitoring/prometheus.yml`)
  - Metrics collection from all services
  - Custom alerting rules for SLAs
  - Service discovery and scraping configuration

- **Grafana** (`monitoring/grafana/`)
  - Pre-configured dashboards
  - Data source provisioning
  - BidFlow-specific visualization

- **Jaeger** (Distributed Tracing)
  - OpenTelemetry collector configuration
  - Trace collection from all services
  - Performance bottleneck identification

- **OpenTelemetry** (`monitoring/otel-collector-config.yaml`)
  - Centralized telemetry collection
  - Multi-backend export (Jaeger, Prometheus)
  - Trace and metrics correlation

### 5. SLA Alerts and Monitoring ✅
- **Parsing Latency Alerts**:
  - Warning: >2s (95th percentile) for 2 minutes
  - Critical: >5s (95th percentile) for 1 minute

- **Cost Engine Error Rate Alerts**:
  - Warning: >5% error rate for 2 minutes
  - Critical: >10% error rate for 1 minute

- **Additional Monitoring**:
  - Service availability (30s downtime threshold)
  - Resource utilization (90% memory threshold)
  - Database connection health
  - Response time monitoring

## 📊 SLA Compliance Dashboard

The Grafana dashboard provides real-time monitoring of:

| Metric | SLA Target | Implementation |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| **NLP Parsing Latency** | <2s (95th percentile) | ✅ Prometheus histogram with alerting |
| **Cost Engine Error Rate** | <5% | ✅ Error counter with rate calculation |
| **System Availability** | >99.9% | ✅ Service health monitoring |
| **Response Time** | <3s | ✅ Request duration tracking |

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Local Development
```bash
# Start complete development environment
./deploy.sh dev

# Access services at:
# - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# - NLP API: http://localhost:8000  
# - Grafana: http://localhost:3001
# - Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
# - Jaeger: http://localhost:16686
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to Kubernetes
./deploy.sh k8s production

# Monitor deployment status
kubectl get pods -n bidflow
kubectl logs -f deployment/nlp-engine -n bidflow
```

### Performance Testing
```bash
# Run automated load tests
./deploy.sh load-test

# Validates SLA compliance:
# - 95% requests < 2s
# - Error rate < 5%
```

## 🔧 Operational Excellence

### Automated Operations
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Fully automated testing, building, and deployment
- **Health Monitoring**: Automatic service health checks and recovery
- **Alert Management**: Proactive alerting before SLA breaches
- **Performance Testing**: Continuous load testing and validation

### Observability
- **Metrics**: Comprehensive Prometheus metrics for all services
- **Tracing**: End-to-end request tracing with Jaeger
- **Logging**: Structured logging with centralized collection

## 🎯 Deployment Verification

After deployment, verify the following:

### Service Health
```bash
# Check all services are running
kubectl get pods -n bidflow

# Verify health endpoints
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### SLA Monitoring
- Access Grafana at http://localhost:3001
- Verify "BidFlow System Dashboard" shows green metrics
- Confirm alerts are not firing

### Performance Testing
- Run load tests: `./deploy.sh load-test`
- Verify 95th percentile latency < 2s
- Confirm error rate < 5%
