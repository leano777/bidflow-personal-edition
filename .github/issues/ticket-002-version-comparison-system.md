# Version Comparison System (TICKET-002)

**Priority**: High  
**Complexity**: Large  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 weeks  
**Category**: Version Control & UI  

## Description

Implement a comprehensive version comparison system that allows users to view side-by-side comparisons of different proposal versions with detailed change tracking and visual indicators.

## Current State

- Version control exists in `ProposalEditor.tsx`
- Version creation and metadata handling implemented
- No side-by-side comparison interface
- No change tracking visualization
- No diff highlighting system

## Requirements

### Side-by-Side Comparison
- [ ] Split-screen interface showing two versions simultaneously
- [ ] Synchronized scrolling between versions
- [ ] Version selector dropdown for each side
- [ ] Responsive design that works on different screen sizes
- [ ] Toggle between different comparison modes (side-by-side, overlay)

### Change Tracking
- [ ] Highlight added, modified, and deleted content
- [ ] Color-coded change indicators (green for additions, red for deletions, yellow for modifications)
- [ ] Line-by-line change detection for text content
- [ ] Numerical change tracking for pricing and quantities
- [ ] Summary of changes with statistics

### Visual Indicators
- [ ] Change summary panel with total modifications count
- [ ] Navigation controls to jump between changes
- [ ] Expandable/collapsible change sections
- [ ] Timeline view of version history
- [ ] Change author and timestamp information

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Export comparison report to PDF
- [ ] Comments and annotations on specific changes
- [ ] Approval workflow for version changes
- [ ] Merge capabilities for combining versions
- [ ] Change impact analysis (cost differences, timeline effects)

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes
- Create `VersionComparison.tsx` component
- Implement `DiffViewer.tsx` for change visualization
- Add `VersionSelector.tsx` for version navigation
- Create `ChangesSummary.tsx` for statistics display
- Integrate comparison UI into `ProposalWorkspace.tsx`

### Backend Changes
- Create `/compare-versions` endpoint
- Implement diff algorithm for proposal data structures
- Add change tracking metadata to version records
- Create version comparison data models

### Data Processing
- JSON diff algorithm for proposal structure comparison
- Text diff for description and scope content
- Numerical comparison for pricing changes
- Change categorization and impact analysis

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Users can select any two versions for comparison
- [ ] Side-by-side view clearly shows differences
- [ ] Changes are visually highlighted with appropriate colors
- [ ] Change summary provides accurate statistics
- [ ] Navigation between changes works smoothly
- [ ] Performance is acceptable for large proposals
- [ ] Interface is responsive on different screen sizes
- [ ] Version history timeline is accessible and informative

## User Stories

**As a contractor**, I want to compare different versions of my proposal so that I can track what changes were made and when.

**As a project manager**, I want to see the cost impact of version changes so that I can make informed decisions about modifications.

**As a client reviewer**, I want to easily identify what changed between proposal revisions so that I can focus on the modifications.

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Test comparison with various proposal sizes
- [ ] Test performance with many versions
- [ ] Test change detection accuracy
- [ ] Test UI responsiveness on different devices
- [ ] Test synchronized scrolling functionality
- [ ] Integration testing with version control system

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Implement efficient diff algorithms
- Use virtualization for large proposals
- Cache comparison results when possible
- Optimize re-rendering for smooth interactions

### Accessibility
- Ensure color-blind friendly change indicators
- Provide keyboard navigation
- Add screen reader support for changes
- Maintain proper contrast ratios

## Dependencies

- Existing version control system
- Proposal data structure consistency
- UI component library updates

## Related Issues

- Integrates with version control functionality
- May require export system updates
- Related to collaboration features
