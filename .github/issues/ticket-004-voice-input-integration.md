# Voice Input Integration (TICKET-004)

**Priority**: Medium  
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: 3-5 days  
**Category**: AI Features & Input Methods  

## Description

Implement voice input functionality that allows users to add scope items, descriptions, and measurements through voice commands with speech-to-text conversion and intelligent parsing.

## Current State

- No voice input capabilities currently exist
- Manual text input only for all proposal content
- AI processing exists for text-based proposal generation
- Basic UI components available for scope management

## Requirements

### Core Voice Features
- [ ] Speech-to-text conversion using Web Speech API or cloud service
- [ ] Voice activation controls (push-to-talk and continuous listening)
- [ ] Real-time voice transcription display
- [ ] Voice command parsing for scope items
- [ ] Multi-language support (starting with English)

### Intelligent Voice Processing
- [ ] Parse measurements and quantities from voice input
- [ ] Recognize construction terminology and materials
- [ ] Auto-categorize scope items based on voice descriptions
- [ ] Handle multiple items in single voice input
- [ ] Correction and confirmation dialogs for parsed content

### UI Integration
- [ ] Voice input controls in proposal editor
- [ ] Visual feedback during recording and processing
- [ ] Voice input overlay with transcription display
- [ ] Integration with existing scope management interface
- [ ] Mobile-friendly voice controls

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Voice commands for navigation ("go to materials", "add electrical")
- [ ] Voice editing of existing scope items
- [ ] Voice-to-measurement conversion (e.g., "twenty feet" â†’ "20 ft")
- [ ] Voice shortcuts for common actions

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes
- Create `VoiceInput.tsx` component with recording controls
- Add `VoiceTranscription.tsx` for real-time display
- Implement `VoiceCommandParser.tsx` for intelligent parsing
- Integrate voice controls into `ProposalEditor.tsx`
- Add voice-specific UI states and feedback

### Backend Integration
- Create `/voice-to-scope` endpoint for processing voice data
- Implement voice command parsing logic
- Add measurement and terminology recognition
- Integrate with existing AI processing pipeline

### Browser APIs
- Web Speech API for speech recognition
- MediaDevices API for microphone access
- Audio processing and noise reduction
- Browser compatibility handling

## User Experience Flow

1. User clicks voice input button in scope editor
2. System requests microphone permission
3. User speaks scope item description
4. Real-time transcription appears on screen
5. AI processes voice input and suggests scope items
6. User reviews and confirms parsed content
7. Scope items are added to proposal automatically

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Users can activate voice input with clear visual feedback
- [ ] Speech is accurately transcribed in real-time
- [ ] Voice descriptions are intelligently parsed into scope items
- [ ] Measurements and quantities are correctly extracted
- [ ] Voice input works reliably across different browsers
- [ ] Error handling provides clear user feedback
- [ ] Voice input integrates seamlessly with existing workflow
- [ ] Performance is acceptable for typical voice input sessions

## Technical Considerations

### Privacy and Security
- Local processing when possible to protect privacy
- Clear user consent for microphone access
- No permanent storage of voice recordings
- Secure transmission of voice data when cloud processing required

### Performance
- Efficient speech processing to minimize latency
- Offline capabilities when possible
- Progressive enhancement for browsers without speech support
- Optimized audio processing to reduce CPU usage

### Accessibility
- Keyboard alternatives for all voice features
- Visual indicators for hearing-impaired users
- Adjustable voice input sensitivity
- Integration with screen readers

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Test voice recognition accuracy across different accents
- [ ] Test microphone permission handling
- [ ] Test voice input in various noise environments
- [ ] Test browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Test mobile device voice input
- [ ] Test voice command parsing accuracy
- [ ] Performance testing with extended voice sessions

## Browser Compatibility

### Supported Browsers
- Chrome 25+ (full Web Speech API support)
- Firefox 44+ (limited support)
- Safari 14.1+ (webkit implementation)
- Edge 79+ (Chromium-based)

### Fallback Strategy
- Graceful degradation for unsupported browsers
- Alternative text input methods
- Clear messaging about browser requirements

## Dependencies

- Web Speech API or cloud speech service
- Microphone access permissions
- AI processing pipeline for voice parsing
- Construction terminology database

## Future Enhancements

- Voice training for improved accuracy
- Custom vocabulary for construction terms
- Voice macros for complex operations
- Integration with photo analysis for measurements
- Multi-user voice collaboration

## Related Issues

- Integrates with AI proposal generation
- Enhances scope management workflow
- May connect with mobile app development
- Related to accessibility improvements
