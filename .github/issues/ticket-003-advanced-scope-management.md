# Advanced Scope Management (TICKET-003)

**Priority**: High  
**Complexity**: Large  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 weeks  
**Category**: Scope Management & Pricing  

## Description

Enhance the existing scope management system with advanced features including template management, bulk operations, intelligent grouping, and sophisticated pricing controls.

## Current State

- Basic scope management exists in `ProposalEditor.tsx`
- Material database integration through `MaterialDatabase.tsx`
- Bulk pricing adjustment available in `BulkPricingAdjustment.tsx`
- Waste factor calculations implemented
- Labor rate management present

## Requirements

### Scope Templates
- [ ] Create reusable scope templates for common project types
- [ ] Template categories (foundation, framing, electrical, plumbing, etc.)
- [ ] Custom template creation and management
- [ ] Template sharing and importing
- [ ] Quick template application to new proposals

### Bulk Operations
- [ ] Bulk edit multiple scope items simultaneously
- [ ] Mass pricing updates with percentage adjustments
- [ ] Bulk category reassignment
- [ ] Multi-select operations with keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Bulk import/export of scope items

### Intelligent Grouping
- [ ] Auto-categorization based on item descriptions
- [ ] Custom grouping rules and logic
- [ ] Drag-and-drop reordering within groups
- [ ] Collapsible group sections
- [ ] Group-level pricing summaries

### Advanced Pricing Features
- [ ] Dynamic pricing based on project size/complexity
- [ ] Tiered pricing models (different rates by quantity)
- [ ] Regional pricing variations
- [ ] Seasonal pricing adjustments
- [ ] Profit margin controls per category

### Enhanced UI/UX
- [ ] Improved scope item editor with inline editing
- [ ] Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- [ ] Quick add functionality with auto-complete
- [ ] Keyboard navigation and shortcuts
- [ ] Undo/redo for scope changes

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Enhancements
- Extend `ProposalEditor.tsx` with advanced scope features
- Create `ScopeTemplates.tsx` component for template management
- Enhance `BulkPricingAdjustment.tsx` with additional operations
- Implement `ScopeGrouping.tsx` for intelligent categorization
- Add `AdvancedScopeEditor.tsx` with inline editing capabilities

### Backend Changes
- Create `/scope-templates` endpoints for CRUD operations
- Add `/bulk-operations` endpoints for mass updates
- Implement `/pricing-rules` for dynamic pricing logic
- Enhance material database with advanced querying
- Add scope analytics and reporting endpoints

### Data Models
- Scope template data structure
- Grouping rules and categories
- Pricing rule engine
- Bulk operation audit trail
- Template usage analytics

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Users can create and manage scope templates
- [ ] Bulk operations work efficiently for large scope lists
- [ ] Intelligent grouping accurately categorizes items
- [ ] Advanced pricing features calculate correctly
- [ ] UI is responsive and intuitive for complex operations
- [ ] Performance remains good with large scope datasets
- [ ] Template sharing works reliably
- [ ] Undo/redo functionality works correctly

## User Stories

**As a contractor**, I want to save frequently used scope items as templates so that I can quickly build similar proposals.

**As a project estimator**, I want to bulk update pricing across multiple items so that I can efficiently adjust for market changes.

**As a proposal manager**, I want intelligent grouping of scope items so that my proposals are well-organized and professional.

## Performance Considerations

### Frontend Optimization
- Virtualization for large scope lists
- Debounced search and filtering
- Memoization of expensive calculations
- Efficient re-rendering strategies
- Progressive loading of scope data

### Backend Optimization
- Efficient bulk operation processing
- Database indexing for scope queries
- Caching of frequently used templates
- Optimized pricing rule evaluation

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Test template creation and application
- [ ] Test bulk operations with various data sizes
- [ ] Test intelligent grouping accuracy
- [ ] Test pricing calculations under different scenarios
- [ ] Test UI responsiveness with large datasets
- [ ] Test data integrity during bulk operations
- [ ] Performance testing with maximum scope sizes

## Integration Points

### Material Database
- Enhanced material search and selection
- Automatic material suggestions based on scope
- Integration with supplier pricing APIs
- Material availability and lead time tracking

### AI Integration
- AI-powered scope item generation
- Intelligent pricing suggestions
- Auto-categorization using AI
- Scope optimization recommendations

## Security Considerations

- Template access controls
- Bulk operation permissions
- Data validation for bulk updates
- Audit logging for scope changes
- Rate limiting for bulk operations

## Dependencies

- Existing material database system
- Pricing calculation engine
- User permission system
- Template storage infrastructure

## Migration Strategy

- Gradual rollout of advanced features
- Backward compatibility with existing scopes
- Data migration for existing proposals
- User training and documentation updates

## Related Issues

- Integrates with material database
- Related to AI proposal generation
- Connects to pricing and estimation features
- May impact export system formatting
