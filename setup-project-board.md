## Manual Steps to Complete Setup

### 1. Add Issues to Project Board
Visit your project board: https://github.com/users/leano777/projects/5

For each issue above:
1. Click "Add item" in the project board
2. Search for the issue number (e.g., "#6")
3. Add it to the "To Do" column

### 2. Set Up Project Board Columns (if needed)
Create these columns in your project board:
- **Backlog**: For identified features not yet prioritized
- **To Do**: For prioritized items ready for development
- **In Progress**: For currently active work
- **Review**: For code review and testing phase  
- **Done**: For completed and deployed features

### 3. Organize Issues by Priority
Move issues to appropriate columns:
- **High Priority (Issues #6, #7, #8)**: Move to "To Do" column
- **Medium Priority (Issues #9, #10)**: Keep in "Backlog" initially
- **Low Priority (Issue #11)**: Keep in "Backlog"

### 4. Set Up Project Board Views (Optional)
You can create filtered views by:
- Priority level
- Labels (ai-feature, export, ui-ux, etc.)
- Assignee
- Status
